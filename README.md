# Ruby-OOP-Project-Game

In this project we're required to create a Tic Tac Toe Game using Ruby with OOP concepts.

> This project is split in 4 milestones, which were:

- Setting up the project
- Designing the user interface
- Creating the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

> The main goal of this project is to asure the mastery on the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.


## Live Demo

You can play the game on repl.it platform, skip enviroment set up section and follow how to play section

- [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Prabhakarzx/Ruby-OOP-Project-Game)](https://repl.it/github/Prabhakarzx/Ruby-OOP-Project-Game)


## Enviroment set up requirements

To run this game, you need ruby installed in your enviroment.
Run the following commend:

```
$ ruby -v
```

You should a have a result similar to this:

```
ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-linux]

If you don't get that result, follow this [link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and install Ruby in your local enviroment.

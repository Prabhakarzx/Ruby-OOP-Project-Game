# Ruby-OOP-Project-Game

In this project we're required to create a Tic Tac Toe Game using Ruby with OOP concepts.

> This project is split in 4 milestones, which were:

- Setting up the project
- Designing the user interface
- Creating the game logic
- Writing the game instructions

> The main goal of this project is to asure the mastery on the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.

## How to play:

### Tic Tac Toe game rules:



![board](../lib/Tic_Tac_Toe%20Example.gif)

- The game start with an empty board (image on the left).
- Player 1 start by one case using X or O and Player 2 continue by filling the next case using remaining symbol.
- The game continue until we have a winning combination (check images below) or the grid is full and it is a draw.
  ![Winning combinaison](https://st3.depositphotos.com/4695643/13784/v/1600/depositphotos_137841074-stock-illustration-set-collection-of-tic-tac.jpg)
- Winning combinaison are full row, full column or full diagonal.

### Play the game:

- Use the live version on repl.it plateform above or clone this repository into your local enviroment and CD to the folder.
- Run this command:

```
$ ./bin/main.rb
```

- You have two option: 1 start new game or 2 quit the game.

- The game start with an emty board and a score of player 1: 0 and player 2: 0
-
- The game show the board status, whose player turn is and the possible moves. The player should choose the available positions presented in a 2D array

- The game continue until we get a winning combinaison or a draw.

- If a player win, the score get increased and you have 2 options: Continue or Quit.


## Live Demo

You can play the game on repl.it platform, skip enviroment set up section and follow how to play section

- [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Prabhakarzx/Ruby-OOP-Project-Game)](https://repl.it/github/Prabhakarzx/Ruby-OOP-Project-Game)


## Enviroment set up requirements

To run this game, you need ruby installed in your enviroment.
Run the following commend:

```
$ ruby -v
```

You should a have a result similar to this:

```
ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-linux]
```

If you don't get that result, follow this [link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and install Ruby in your local enviroment.
